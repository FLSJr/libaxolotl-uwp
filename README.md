# libaxolotl-windows
An independent implementation of the axolotl protocol, loosely based on WhisperSystems/libaxolotl-java.

Depends on langboost/curve25519-uwp.

This implementation benefited greatly from Github user smndtrl on the actual implementation. There are still features to port, so pull requests are welcome.
